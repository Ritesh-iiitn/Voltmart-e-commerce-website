This project is a full-fledged e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack — comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It enables users to explore products, manage a shopping cart, and simulate a complete checkout flow with server-side validation and order processing.
The interface is crafted to be responsive and intuitive, ensuring a smooth user journey across devices. Core features include product filtering, secure user authentication, and order confirmation. The backend integrates with Weaviate, a vector-based search engine, to offer smart product recommendations tailored to user behavior — enhancing product discovery and engagement.
